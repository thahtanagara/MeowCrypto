# MeowCrypto

**MeowCrypto** is a terminal-based tool for cryptographic operations, including encryption and decryption using AES, DES, RSA, and Vigen√®re ciphers. This project is designed for developers and security enthusiasts to experiment with various cryptographic algorithms.

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
- Encrypt and decrypt using DES (Data Encryption Standard).
- Encrypt and decrypt using RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).
- Encrypt and decrypt using the Vigen√®re cipher.
- User-friendly terminal interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thahtanagara/MeowCrypto.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MeowCrypto
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Make the script executable (Linux/Mac):
   ```bash
   chmod +x meow.py
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the tool from the terminal:

```bash
python3 meow.py
```

Or if made executable:

```bash
./meow.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation (encryption or decryption) and a cryptographic algorithm.

## Examples

### AES Encryption
Input:
```
Enter text to encrypt: Hello, World!
Enter key (16/24/32 bytes): mysecretkey12345
```
Output:
```
Encrypted text: b'\xf3\x1a\x9b\x0e...'
```

### RSA Decryption
Input:
```
Enter encrypted text: 0a3b...
Enter private key: -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ...
```
Output:
```
Decrypted text: Hello, World!
```
